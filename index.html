            Perhaps the most famous basketball player of all time, Michael Jordan has been in the GOAT conversation for a long time now. Air Jordan  is the GOAT on most peoples' lists and also considered the greatest scorer by some. His astonishing offensive and defensive abilities and stats have kept him on the top for a while.
            <br><br> Besides his incredible displays on the court, he also has a massive off-court influence with his Nike Jordan brand.

    <a href="index.html"><h1>LeBron James</h1></a>
    <div class="PlayerHome">
        <div id="LeBronIntro">
            Long live the King, literally! LeBron James has been nicknamed 'the King', and he is often credited for his longevity with this season being his 20th NBA season of his career. All his 19 previous seasons displayed top-tier stats and consistent performances. He has been the second-placer in the GOAT converstion for a while now. He looks to overpass the third player in this list in career points this season, doing so puts him at the top spot of the NBA Scoring List.

        <div id="KareemIntro">
            Arguably the Greatest big man in league history, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar also has a strong case for the GOAT title in my opinion. The pioneer of the skyhook, his signature move, is also the holder of the top spot in the NBA Scoring List, which means he has the most points scored in an NBA career among all. His stature, standing at 7 feet and 2 inches, has helped him lead the league multiple times in scoring, rebounding, and blocking.
